# sentimental_analysis
Sentimental analysis for final projects using [Julia](https://julialang.org). [Setup Julia in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia)

## Important Notes
Before compiling the code make sure to follow this step:
- Open command palette (ctrl + shift + p)
- Choose `Julia: Change Current Environment`
- Choose `sentimental_analysis` on the environment options

If you already installed the julia extension in VSCode, it is similar to jupyter notebook but in VSCode without using the `.ipynb` file extension, `Ctrl + Enter` to execute a line based on your cursor or multiple lines of highlighted code
